									<h2>Slots & CTOT</h2>
									
									<p>My  flightplan tells me that I have a slot! What is a slot?</p>
									
									<p>A slot is also called CTOT (Calculated Takeoff Time) and is used in the real world to manage departures. If you have been assigned a CTOT, it is due to the amount of flights we are expecting at the same time as you.</p>

									<p>The time of your slot is the time you should be cleared for takeoff. The margin is -5 to +10 minutes. In order to ensure everybody adheres to their assigned slot times, you will be asked by Kastrup Delivery to report ready for startup 15 minutes prior to your assigned slot time. This will ensure you have adequate time to startup, taxi and depart on time.</p>

									<h2>Copenhagen, Kastrup & ATC Callsigns</h2>

									<p>Copenhagen Airport is located on Amager, more specifically in the Kastrup municipality.</p>

									<p>Because of this callsigns of the ATC you will be talking to differs, depending on which station you are communicating with. Below you'll find a brief breakdown.</p>
									<p>EKCH_DEL: Kastrup Delivery</p>
									<p>EKCH_GND: Kastrup Apron</p>
									<p>EKCH_TWR: Kastrup Tower</p>
									<p>EKCH_APP: Copenhagen Approach</p>
									<p>EKCH_DEP: Kastrup Departure</p>
									<p>EKCH_F_APP: Kastrup Final</p>
									<p>EKDK_CTR: Copenhagen Control</p>
